The password Generator application uses a very basic console interface using console.log() for output and input using the prompt function (from the prompt-sync package).
The program can generate a number of passwords of any given length using symbols provided by the user. 
The program can display the passwords to the console or write them to a file.
To use the generate password program you have to first install prompt-sync package using (npm install prompt-sync) command
then (node passwordGenerator.js)
